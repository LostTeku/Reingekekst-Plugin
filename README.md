# Reingekekst-Plugin
 A troll plugin for trolling other players, who could've guessed!

 Currently there are only 5 commands that are available.

Command | Permission | Description 
-------- | -------- | --------
/nofood [player] | keksi.nofood | The player can't fill up his foodbar with any type of food. 
/freeze [player] | keksi.freeze | The player can't move 
/tnt [player] | keksi.tnt | Spawns a tnt-block over the player. The player will get damage from it, when the player doesn't move quickly.
/starve [player] | keksi.starve | The foodbar of the player will be set to 0. The player has to eat something, otherwise he will suffer damage.
/fire [player] [duration in seconds] | keksi.fire | Ignites the target-player. Will deal damage to him. 

Nearly all command-effects on target-players can be cleared when the command is typed again.

Have fun!
